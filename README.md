# IMU-GPS-Fusion
Sensor fusion using a particle filter based off of "Particle Filter Data Fusion Enhancements for MEMS-IMU/GPS" by afei Ren, Xizhen Ke. https://file.scirp.org/pdf/IIM20100700004_41189508.pdf

The particle filter is implemented using the SMCTC library. https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/johansen/smctc/
